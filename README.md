# libft

## Overview

The libft project is an introductory project at 42 school, which aims to recreate some standard C library functions as well as additional utility functions. It serves as a fundamental library that you can use in your future projects at 42.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

1. **libft.a**: The compiled library containing the implemented functions.

2. **Includes**: Header files (.h) for the functions provided in the library.

3. **Sources**: The source files (.c) containing the implementation of the library functions.

4. **Bonus**: Additional functions that extend the functionality of the library beyond the required ones.

## Implemented Functions

The library includes implementations of standard C library functions as well as additional utility functions. Some of the key functions implemented include:

- Memory manipulation functions (`memset`, `bzero`, `memcpy`, `memccpy`, `memmove`, `memchr`, `memcmp`, `calloc`).
- String manipulation functions (`strlen`, `strcpy`, `strncpy`, `strcat`, `strncat`, `strlcat`, `strchr`, `strrchr`, `strstr`, `strnstr`, `strcmp`, `strncmp`, `atoi`, `itoa`).
- Character classification functions (`isalpha`, `isdigit`, `isalnum`, `isascii`, `isprint`, `toupper`, `tolower`).
- Memory allocation functions (`malloc`, `free`, `calloc`).
- Linked list manipulation functions (bonus).
